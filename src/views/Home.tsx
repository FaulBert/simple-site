      <h1>Hello, my name is Nazan (aka Nazhard)</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a junior full-stack web developer, junior high school student, and weeb.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a coder who programs as a hobby and hopes to get a job as a full-stack developer in the future.
        I'm not really interested in working,
        I love programming,
        maybe one day I'll just freelance.
      </p>

      <h2> Somethings... \_(ãƒ„)_/ </h2>
      <p>
        Most of my projects are on GitHub,
        I don't have enough storage on my phone to store all the node_modules and files like index.html
      </p>

      <p>
        Wish I could buy a new device,
        I have a serious project at the moment,
        and I need a tiger-powered machine.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the way,
        currently my projects are all private haha,
        I'm just learning,
        so a bit embarrassed, {"><"}
